Deepfake Detection System (DFS)

AI-Powered Detection of Manipulated Media
Real-time deepfake detection using CNN/LSTM models, face recognition, and frame-level analysis for ensuring authenticity of videos and images.

Overview

The Deepfake Detection System (DFS) is designed to identify manipulated videos and images with high precision. Leveraging deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs), the system analyzes facial movements, pixel inconsistencies, and temporal patterns to flag fake content.

DFS is built to support applications in cybersecurity, media verification, law enforcement, and social media monitoring, offering reliable detection against synthetic content generated by modern deepfake technologies.
