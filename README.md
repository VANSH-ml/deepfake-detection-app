🛡 Safeguarding Digital Trust with AI

Deepfake Detection System (DFS)

AI-Powered Detection of Manipulated Media
Real-time deepfake detection using CNN/LSTM models, face recognition, and frame-level analysis to ensure authenticity of videos and images.

📖 Overview

The Deepfake Detection System (DFS) is designed to identify manipulated videos and images with high precision. Leveraging advanced deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs), DFS analyzes facial movements, pixel-level inconsistencies, and temporal patterns to flag fake content in real time.

DFS supports use cases in:

🛡 Cybersecurity (fraud prevention, identity protection)

📰 Media Verification (news authenticity, fact-checking)

🚓 Law Enforcement (forensic analysis)

📱 Social Media Monitoring (misinformation detection)

✨ Features

🔎 Real-time Deepfake Detection
Analyze uploaded videos, images, or webcam streams for manipulated content.

🖼 Image & Frame-Level Analysis
Detect inconsistencies in individual images or extracted frames.

🎥 Video Upload & Processing
Automatic frame extraction → deep learning analysis → detection results.

📊 Probability Score & Visualization
Output confidence levels (e.g., 92% Real | 8% Fake) with graphical insights.

⚡ AI-Powered Models

CNNs for spatial feature extraction.

LSTMs for sequential frame analysis.

Transfer learning with models like EfficientNet & XceptionNet.

View Results – Get authenticity score & flagged regions.

Download Report – Export detection summary for verification/compliance.

🖼 Example Outputs

📹 Video Processing Workflow:
Video → Frames → CNN/LSTM Analysis → Authenticity Score

✅ Real Face → Green bounding box
❌ Fake/Morphed Face → Red bounding box (with probability score)

Sample Result:

Video Authenticity: 87% Real | 13% Fake
Frames Flagged: 42 / 120
